i kept the right ones out and let the wrong ones in had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins there were times in my life when i was goin' insane tryin' to walk through the pain when i lost my grip and i hit the floor yeah, i thought i could leave, but couldn't get out the door i was so sick and tired of livin' a lie i was wishin' that i would die it's amazing with the blink of an eye you finally see the light it's amazing when the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright it's amazing and i'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight that one last shot's a permanent vacation and how high can you fly with broken wings? life's a journey not a destination and i just can't tell just what tomorrow brings you have to learn to crawl before you learn to walk but i just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk i was out on the street just tryin' to survive scratchin' to stay alive it's amazing with the blink of an eye you finally see the light it's amazing when the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright it's amazing and i'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight desperate hearts did you wanna see without and give it out now oh, it's amazing so, from all of us at aerosmith to all of you, wherever you are remember, the light at the end of the tunnel may be you goodnight
