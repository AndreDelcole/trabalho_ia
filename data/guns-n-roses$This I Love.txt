and now i don't know why she wouldn't say goodbye but then it seems that i had seen it in her eyes and it might not be wise i'd still have to try with all the love i have inside i can't deny i just can't let it die cause her heart's just like mine and she holds her pain inside so if you ask me why she wouldn't say goodbye i know somewhere inside there is a special light still shining bright and even on the darkest night she can't deny so if she's somewhere near me i hope to god she hears me there's no one else could ever make me feel i'm so alive i hoped she'd never leave me please, god, you must believe me i've searched the universe and found myself within' her eyes no matter how i try they say it's all a lie so what's the use of my confessions to a crime of passions that won't die in my heart so if she's somewhere near me i hope to god she hears me there's no one else could ever make me feel i'm so alive i hoped she'd never leave me please god you must believe me i've searched the universe and found myself within' her eyes so if she's somewhere near me i hope to god she hears me there's no one else could ever make me feel i'm so alive i hoped she'd never leave me please god you must believe me i've searched the universe and found myself within' her eyes so now i don't know why she wouldn't say goodbye it just might be that i had seen it in her eyes and now it seems that i gave up my ghost of pride i'll never say goodbye
