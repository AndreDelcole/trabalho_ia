when i look into your eyes i can see a love restrained but, darlin', when i hold you don't you know i feel the same? 'cause nothin' lasts forever and we both know hearts can change and it's hard to hold a candle in the cold november rain we've been through this such a long, long time just tryin' to kill the pain, oh, yeah but lovers always come and lovers always go and no one's really sure who's lettin' go today walking away if we could take the time to lay it on the line i could rest my head just knowin' that you were mine all mine so, if you want to love me then, darlin', don't refrain or i'll just end up walkin' in the cold november rain do you need some time on your own? do you need some time all alone? everybody needs some time on their own don't you know you need some time all alone? i know it's hard to keep an open heart when even friends seem all to harm you but if you could heal a broken heart wouldn't time be out to charm you? sometimes i need some time on my own sometimes i need some time all alone oh, everybody needs some time on their own oh, don't you know you need some time all alone? and when your fears subside and shadows still remain oh, yeah i know that you can love me when there's no one left to blame so never mind the darkness we still can find a way 'cause nothin' lasts forever even cold november rain don't ya think that you need somebody? don't ya think that you need someone? everybody needs somebody you're not the only one you're not the only one don't ya think that you need somebody? don't ya think that you need someone? everybody needs somebody you're not the only one you're not the only one don't ya think that you need somebody? don't ya think that you need someone? everybody needs somebody you're not the only one you're not the only one don't ya think that you need somebody? don't ya think that you need someone? everybody needs somebody
