when you're talking to yourself and nobody's home you can fool yourself you came in this world alone (alone) so nobody ever told you, baby, how it was gonna be so what'll happen to you, baby? guess we'll have to wait and see one, two old at heart, but i'm only 28 and i'm much too young to let love break my heart young at heart, but it's getting much too late to find ourselves so far apart i don't know how you're supposed to find me lately and what more could you ask from me? how could you say that i never needed you? when you took everything said you took everything from me young at heart, and it gets so hard to wait when no one i know can seem to help me now old at heart, but i mustn't hesitate if i'm to find my own way out still talking to myself and nobody's home (alone) so nobody ever told us, baby, how it was gonna be so what'll happen to us, baby? guess we'll have to wait and see when i find all of the reasons maybe i'll find another way find another day with all the changing seasons of my life maybe i'll get it right next time and now that you've been broken down got your head out of the clouds you're back down on the ground you don't talk so loud, and you don't walk so proud anymore, and what for? well i jumped into the river too many times to make it home i'm out here on my own drifting all alone if it doesn't show give it time to read between the lines 'cause i see the storm is getting closer and the waves, they get so high seems everything we've ever known's here why must it drift away and die? i'll never find anyone to replace you guess i'll have to make it through this time, oh this time, without you i knew the storm was getting closer and all my friends said i was high but everything we've ever known's here i never wanted it to die
