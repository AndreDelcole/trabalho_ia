i wake up and wonder how everything went wrong am i the one to blame? i gave up and left you for a nowhere-bound train now that train has come and gone i close my eyes and see you lying in my bed and i'm still dreaming of that day what could have been love should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me and now that i'm alone all i have is emptiness that comes from being free what could have been love will never be an old friend told me that you found somebody new ohh, you're finally moving on oh, you think that i'd be over you after all these years yeah, but time has proved me wrong 'cause i'm still holdin' on, yeahh! what could have been love should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me and now that i'm alone all i have is emptiness that comes from being free what could have been love will never be we've gone our separate ways say goodbye to another day i still wonder where you are are you too far from turning back? you were slipping through my hands and i didn't understand what could have been love should have been the only thing that was ever meant to be didn't know, couldn't see what was right in front of me and now that i'm alone all i have is emptiness that comes from being free what could have been love will never be what could have been love will never be what could have been love what could have been love what could have been love what could have been what could have been what could have been love
